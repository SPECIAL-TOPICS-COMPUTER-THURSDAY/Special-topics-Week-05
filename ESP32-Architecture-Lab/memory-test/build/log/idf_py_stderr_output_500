Command: cmake -G Ninja -DPYTHON_DEPS_CHECKED=1 -DPYTHON=/opt/esp/python_env/idf6.0_py3.12_env/bin/python -DESP_PLATFORM=1 -DCCACHE_ENABLE=1 /project/memory-test
CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  cmake_minimum_required() should be called prior to this top-level project()
  call.  Please see the cmake-commands(7) manual for usage documentation of
  both commands.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    CCACHE_ENABLE
    ESP_PLATFORM
    PYTHON
    PYTHON_DEPS_CHECKED
